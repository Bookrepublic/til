#Defer vs. Async

##Defer

<script src="index.js" defer></script>
```

Defer is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the page has **finished** parsing.

##Async

```
<script src="index.js" async></script>
```

The async attribute is a boolean attribute. When present, it specifies that the script will be executed asynchronously **as soon as it is available**.
